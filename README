The tools and code snippets contained in GENIX:

  gx-load
    This is a set of linker scripts for compiling your code into an ELF
    binary, and a utility for converting this ELF binary into a ROM image.
    This is preferable to using linker scripts to produce a ROM directly
    as it simplifies construction of the ROM header, and allows various
    utilities such as `strip' to be used on the final ELF.

-------[ EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE IS USABLY COMPLETE ]-------
-------[  EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE NEEDS WORK STILL  ]-------

  gx-log
    Patchset for the gens emulator and 68k snippets for producing output
    on the terminal. When certain compile-time parameters are defined,
    these macros produce no code at all.

-------[  EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS ONLY PLANNED   ]-------

  gx-z80
    This is a set of linker scripts for producing COFF binaries for
    the Genesis Z80. It is also a bit of 68000 code for loading these
    binaries onto the Z80 and interacting with the Z80.
